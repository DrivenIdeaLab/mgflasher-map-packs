# mgflasher-map-packs
Custom Code A2Ls/XDFs (Map Packs) for creating custom tunes with the latest custom code!

Usage:
1. Export the car's stock map binary file (bin) from the MG Flasher App
2. Import stock map bin into WinOLS/TunerPro
3. Import the A2L/XDF from this repo for the target stock map and for the target Custom Code version
4. Apply changes to the stock map using the defined Custom Code maps (many can be adjusted in app!)
5. Export your changes from WinOLS/TunerPro and import them to the MG Flasher app
6. Flash the car with the custom flash menu by selecting the newly imported file
7. Enjoy!

Note:
To use A2Ls with WinOLS, ensure you have the WinOLS plugin for Damos/A2L import (OLS521)!
